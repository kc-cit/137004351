<p>"My name is Chase and I am 32 years old. I currently work as an electrician. When I was younger, I served in the Marine Corps and had 1 deployment under my belt that took me to 11 countries. During my time in the Marines, I also spent 2 years on a rodeo team. I have been spending my free time lately attempting to teach myself how to code, primarily in Python, by using codecademy, but I hope to further my knowledge in other coding languages as well. I hope to learn a lot in this class that can help me in my future career."</p>
